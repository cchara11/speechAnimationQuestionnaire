            The purpose of the currrent questionnaire is to evaluate a custom lip-sync animation component that was implemented as part
            of a Master's Thesis project. 
            The component will be compared against two commercial lip-sync animation programms
            <br>
            <p>
            The questionnaire is divided into two parts, each one consists of 34 scenarios. There are multiple scenarios for female models as well as multiple scenarios for male models.
            In each scenario you will choose your preffered animation.

            <p style="color:rgb(146, 55, 55)">Your preference should be based on the following parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p style="color:rgb(146, 55, 55)">The animation looks natural</p></li>
                <li><p style="color:rgb(146, 55, 55)">The animation is synchronized with the audio</p></li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:30px">IMPORTANT NOTE:</p> <p>There are some videos that have different rendering. Since the purpose of the questionnaire is to evaluate 
            the mouth during animation, please ignore the model's appearance and focus only on the mouth part.</p>
